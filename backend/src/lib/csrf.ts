// CSRF protection via the double-submit cookie pattern.

// Session cookies are httpOnly (JS can never read them) and SameSite
// Lax/None, so they alone don't stop a cross-site form/fetch from riding
// along with a signed-in user's session. The fix: a second, *non*-httpOnly
// cookie holding a random token. Legitimate same-origin JS can read that
// cookie and echo it back as a header; a cross-site attacker can trigger
// the cookie to be sent automatically, but can't read its value to put it
// in a header (browsers don't allow cross-origin cookie reads). If the
// header and cookie don't match, the request is rejected.

// still has a leftover doctor/patient session cookie from an earlier,
// expired or otherwise invalid session, the old "only check if a session
// cookie exists" heuristic would wrongly demand a CSRF token that was never
// issued for this attempt, blocking login entirely with "Missing CSRF
// token." Login-type requests are inherently low-risk for CSRF (rate-limited,
// and a forged one just logs the attacker's victim into the attacker's own
// account) and don't need this protection at all.
